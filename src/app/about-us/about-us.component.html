    <h2>Some text about who we are and what we do.</h2>
    <p>As a close-knit group of four students at Hochschule f√ºr Wirtschaft
      und Technik Berlin, we embarked on a thrilling journey to develop a programming
      learning game akin to the iconic Pac-Man as part of our university project.
    </p>
    <p>Our shared passion for coding and game development fueled
      our creativity, leading us to seamlessly blend entertainment with
      educational elements. The collaboration with the real company diva-e
      added an exciting twist to our endeavor, offering us a glimpse into
      the practicalities of the industry. It was an incredible opportunity
      to apply our classroom knowledge in a real-world context.

      not only showcased our technical skills but also allowed us to explore
      the intersection of education and gaming. Working hand-in-hand with diva-e,
      we gained invaluable insights, creating a game that not only engaged
      players but also served as a practical learning tool. This experience
      left an indelible mark on our academic journey, reinforcing the
      importance of bridging theory with hands-on experience in the
      ever-evolving field of programming.</p>
