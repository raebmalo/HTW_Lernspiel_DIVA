    <p>Our journey began as a group of passionate students at Hochschule f√ºr Wirtschaft
      und Technik Berlin.<br>One day during our university project brainstorming session
      the iconic Pac-Man game caught our attention.
    </p>
    <p>The idea of creating a game inspired by Pac-Man struck us as a fun and challenging
      project.<br>We considered it an opportunity to merge classic gaming with modern
      educational elements.
    </p>
    <p>Our shared passion for coding and game development fueled our creativity.<br>
      We envisioned a game that not only entertained players but also served as a practical
      learning tool.<br>This idea marked the beginning of our exciting adventure.
