    <h2>How We Got the Idea</h2>
    <p>Our journey began as a group of passionate students at Hochschule f√ºr Wirtschaft und Technik Berlin. One day, we were brainstorming ideas for our university project, and that's when the iconic Pac-Man game caught our attention.</p>
    <p>The idea of creating a game inspired by Pac-Man struck us as a fun and challenging project. We saw it as an opportunity to merge classic gaming with modern educational elements.</p>
    <p>Our shared passion for coding and game development fueled our creativity. We envisioned a game that not only entertained players but also served as a practical learning tool. This idea marked the beginning of our exciting adventure.</p>
